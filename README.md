# Proof of Concept: Integrating Starfx with ElectricSQL

**Status:** *Work in Progress*

This proof of concept demonstrates how to integrate [Starfx](https://starfx.bower.sh/) with [ElectricSQL](https://electric-sql.com/). It showcases how to set up an ElectricSQL server, connect to a PostgreSQL database, and perform read and sync operations, as well as run a simple Node.js-based CRUD API.

## Prerequisites

1. **PostgreSQL Server**  
   Ensure you have access to a running PostgreSQL instance.  
   For installation and configuration, refer to the official [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

2. **ElectricSQL Server**  
   Follow the [ElectricSQL installation guide](https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/installation) to set up and run your ElectricSQL server.

3. **Node.js and npm**  
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**  
   Create an `.env` file in the project root and define the following keys:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<electricserver>:<port>/<database>
   VITE_ELECTRIC_SERVICE=http://<electricserver>:3000/v1/shape
   ```
   
   - **DATABASE_URL**: Points to your PostgreSQL instance managed by ElectricSQL.
   - **VITE_ELECTRIC_SERVICE**: Defines the service endpoint for ElectricSQLâ€™s sync functionality.

## Running the Servers

1. **ElectricSQL Server**  
   Start the ElectricSQL server according to the official instructions.  
   *(Refer to the [ElectricSQL documentation](https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/installation) for details.)*

2. **Node.js Backend Server**  
   This project includes a simple Node.js HTTP server that provides CRUD operations on sample tables (e.g., `users`, `emails`).  
   To start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

3. **Client Application**  
   Start the development client:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure

- **`src/server/server.js`**: A basic Node.js server handling CRUD operations.
- **Client Side Files**: Located in `src`, configured to connect via the environment variables.

## Notes

- This is a first attempt for the integration of Starfx with ElectricSQL. Most likely in the future, a more refine and optimized version will be available.

<!-- this is a plan of action. not exactly accomplished yet. -->
 <!-- by schema -> api-mdw = subscribe (initialize then go live)
 by api -> start/stop stream
 by api -> parse to store.
 by api -> optimistic operations - insert, update, delete.
